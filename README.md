## Experimental RESTful interface using [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/)

This branch of the InterVA5 package implements an experimental RESTful interface that allows the InterVA5 algorithm to be accessed via a simple API endpoint.

This interface depends on the plumber R package. The plumber package can be installed from within R using the following R command

```
  install.packages("plumber")
```

Once plumber is installed, the interface can be started with the following commands:

```
  cd InterVA5_1.0
  Rscript api.R
```

API documentation will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5002/__swagger__/

To test the API manually:

```
  curl -X POST --data-binary @example-api-request.json localhost:5002/interva5
```
